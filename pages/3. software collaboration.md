This page is important in order to understand how to collaborate not only with other programmers but with other groups like hardware.

# git
is a software tool to track and manage code changes over time. It is important since it allows for concurrent workflows where multiple people can work on the same codebase at the same time and then merge their changes together. we use github, which is built on git and has extra features like issues, boards, and automated pull requests.

## basic workflow
there are two main things we need to understand before we figure out how we can have multiple people work on the same code. Those are commits and branches. A commit is a set of changes. Maybe deleting a file, changing some lines of code, etc. A commit gets applied to a branch and will have a descriptive summary to easily know what changes were made. Here is a picture of github desktop which is a visual client to let you interact with a git repository.

A branch effectively points to a specific point in time in the projects edit history. A branch is typically used to collect a list of commits (changes) together and keep them isolated until we test them. In the diagram below there are 3 branches, Little Feature, Main, and Big Feature. In our workflow Main is considered the stable branch. We want to point all of our branches to main (typically), and test them before we merge our changes into main. Notice how each branch in the image is a "Feature". This matches our workflow. We want to create a branch for each change or feature.
- Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix
- Avoid "large" long lived branches because they are more likely to have merge conflicts.
- DO NOT make changes unrelated to a branches feature in that branch. Instead create a new branch for those changes.

Notice how "Little Feature" is far back from main. It is unaware of the 3 changes after where it branched off. We can do what is called an "update" where we will move our pointer up to the latest change. Typically we only update from main but it is possible to update from any branch. However, there is a potential issue! What if we changed something that was later changed in those 3 changes. This is called a merge conflict. These are detected automatically and we can deal with them easily, by picking which change or to include both changes or even modify them. These merge conflcits are solved as their own commit. We need to be careful when a merge conflict occurs to ensure that we do not break other code. If we modify code in a merge conflict it should be tested again.

how do we know what we need to change? that is where issues come in. An issue is a github (not git) feature which provides and easy way to track a problem or features that need to be implemented. An issue should
- have a clear description (including media like images or video when required) of what needs to happen for it to be closed
- include clearly what needs to be tested on the physical robot (including edge cases) to prevent new issues to be caused by resolving this one.

an example picture of some various issues that may exist. issues can be organized and prioritized by importance (github has a fantastic projects feature for this). There might be bugs like ensuring that the grabber works correctly that are high priority, and features like automatic scoring which aren't as vital to the game, and have a lower priority.

once you solve an issue (or multiple issues), you create what is called a pull request. a pull request includes details on how the issue was solved, including text and media confirming that the issue has been tested on the physical robot by a second party. To help ensure that code is reliable beyond just testing, the code is also reviewed by at least 1 other programmer. They will review the code to try and find bugs or maybe will recommend another way to solve the problem. This should be constructive feedback and review is the most important part of collaborative programming because it helps prevent issues and gives more people familiarity with more of the code.



what is a workflow dependency? (i literally made this phrase up)


hardware changes that require calibration values should be treated specially. As the wrong offset in code could be catastrophic if a feature branch is not up to date. When a change like this occurs all branches must be updated immediately.


## testing


- software plus hardware
	- workflows for software development and how to integrate it into the hardware lifecycle
		- git workflow
		- how to **prioritize** and create issues
			- typical hardware year will start with prototyping and testing (software should work with electrical hardware to have development platforms ready to test)
			- a good way to test mechanisms might be a previous year robot hardware and code
