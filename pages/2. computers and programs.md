A robot may have multiple computer systems on it. It is important to understand how these computers work. The main computer on the robot is the [roboRIO](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/roborio-info/roborio-introduction.html). This computer communicates with the [driver station](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/driverstation/driver-station.html) and field in a standard way and is required on the robot. The roboRIO has no keyboard or monitor, it however can be interacted with using USB and Ethernet. This allows for it to be programmed and instructed with commands like inputs from a controller. The robot can be connected to wirelessly using a [radio](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-3/radio-programming.html) that is connected to the roboRIO and broadcasts or connects to a wifi network.

# binary and data storage
binary is important to understand how computers store data. 

here is an example of storing positive integer numbers. Notice how the number of possible values that can be stored is 2 to the power of N binary digits. watch this ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€[intro to binary numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTcpd4ef2lU)ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ video. These same tricks can be applied to convert N base numbers to decimal (base 10). Even hexidecimal numbers which are base 16 and are typically represented using 0-9 and A-F.

for robotics programming, the "int" type uses 32 bits and can store values between -2^31 and 2^31-1. Notice how this number can be negative! It also looks like we are missing a bit, 31 is less than 32. That is because one bit is actually used to store the sign (positivity) of the number using the [two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement).

How do we store numbers with decimals???? Using [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) floating point numbers of course. In simple terms, they store an exponent and a fraction. In java we use double precision floating point numbers (aka doubles). These numbers have 3 parts, a sign, an exponent, and a fraction. The key thing that needs to be understood about them is that they cannot represent every number. They can also only represent certain approximate values.

This is what causes [floating point error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic#Accuracy_problems) which is why when you add operate on values it might be `1 + 2 = 2.99999999999` rather than `3.0`. However this fraction for a double precision is 52 bits so in practially this is almost never an issue for FRC robots, just a fun quirk of how computers store numbers.

# BASIC programming (literally)
we will learn basic programming by learning TI BASIC. This language is used on texas instruments graphing calculators and is a fantastic practical introduction into programming. If you have a TI graphing calculator feel free to follow along or make your own programs!

# how computers think
It is important to understand how a computer runs code. At a fundemental level all [turing complete computers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqNDk_UJW4k) are simple machines that have a tape of data and a pointer.

the code we write is abstract compared to each instruction a computer runs, but understanding that the computer is just a simple machine which runs an instruction, increments the program counter, and runs the next is helpful to understand how the computer executes the java code line by line.

this video goes over a lot of good computer science concepts. however, it is paced increadibly quickly and does not dive deep into any of the topics. treat this as a glossary of terms ( #todo maybe i just break out some of these concepts manually and find other supporting content as only about half of the video is relevant) ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis))
