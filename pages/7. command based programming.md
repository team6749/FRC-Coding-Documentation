Command based programming is a fantastic way to program robots.  There are subsystems and commands. A subsystem describes a mechanical thing; for instance there might be a subsystem for a turret which has a motor and an encoder to measure the location of the turret. A command is a behavior that can act on a subsystem. This alone does not solve the problem. All it does is segment the issue into individual separated components.

# Subsystem
A subsystem describes the physicality of the robot. Each subsystem should be individual parts that will have separate behavior. For instance a turret and a shooter mounted on top of the turret would be separate subsystems. A grabber component would be its own subsystem. And the drive base would be its own subsystem.

Each of these individual parts have their own distinct functions and behaviors. This is how subsystems are split; since the behavior of one unit is not dependent on another subsystem.

A comand is
