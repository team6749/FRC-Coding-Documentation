This section is a basic introduction to programming and will include making a simple website and an introduction to Java which is the language that we use for programming the robots.

# make a website
We are going to use HTML which is not a programming language like basic which we used in [2. computers and programs](2.%20computers%20and%20programs.md) it is a markup language. Which defines the shape of something rather than it's behavior. When we use Java to program the robots we will define the behavior and the shape. Some of our code will be responsible for defining the behavior and other parts will define the shape (aka describing the physical characteristics of the robot). The difference between this and html is that we have already built the physical robot and we are just describing it in code, whereas html describes the shape of a website for a web browser to display.

it is fun and easy to make a website. This website goes over all of the basics and includes some helpful tools to try it out yourself to make it interactive! You can click on the try it yourself links to edit your own page!
Read this page which goes over the basics of html ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€[https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€
Then read this page which goes over some specific tags ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€[https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp)ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€
Then read this page which goes over how to further style a tag and give it more information. ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€[https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp)ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ 

You can use the left column on the w3schools website to find more tags and learn more about html. 

You can create html files on your computer to save your websites.

fun activity: Make a website that has a picture of a cat!

for further reading look at markdown, which is what was part of what was used to format this document and is what we use for formatting code docs. [https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)

# intro to java
Watch this video that introduces data types and briefly goes over how computers store variables. ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6otW6OXjR8c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6otW6OXjR8c)ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€

This is a solid intro course that goes over many of the basics of java programming and includes sections so that you can watch it in parts because it is a long video. The video is labeled to show each section. It goes over variables, logic, conditionals, control flow, and even introduces object oriented programming. ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoXwIVyNvX0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoXwIVyNvX0)ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€
