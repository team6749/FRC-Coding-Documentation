Telemetry is the most important part of the robot code. Every value that can change should be logged. This is important because you will have minimal time to test your code on the real robot. By using proper logging you can ensure that when you do test you can confidently analyse the results after the test is done. 

- Logging should be automatic
- Telemetry should be sent for live feedback, like determining sensor failures. This process can be two-way, including having data sent back to the robot for things like configuring drive mode or a manual failure override.
- The driver station laptop should record telemetry data off of the robot and store it for later analysis. Programs like shuffleboard
- Since telemetry is dependent on a network connection, and the robot might end up disconnected, or some other issue might occur, the robot should also locally store logs. This is easy to do with the roborio and you can easily add a USB drive to store logs ==https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/telemetry/datalog.html==

Our team might also use third party logging libraries, or tools!
