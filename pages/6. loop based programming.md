As we have seen previously all computers do are run from one instruction to the next. They do this very rapidly; think Billions of times per second. This means that the computer would run our code incredibly quickly! That is not useful. So we must use a loop to run our code over and over again. At a low level, this is a jump to a previous instruction. But at a high level, we can program loops like this in Java.
```java
while (true) {
	//Do something over and over again
}
```
For our simple robot we will program it to run in a loop. All robots are actually run this way. There is a control loop that runs over and over again, usually at a fixed interval. For our robots we will use an abstraction, just like everything else in programming. This loop here is abstracted from the machine code that the processor runs.

# Duck Robot
In this example we will program a robot with 2 limit switches and a little rail driven by a motor. Here is what the robot looks like.
![[duck_robot.png]]

The red direction in this diagram is forward and the blue direction is reverse. The duck is attached to the belt and when the motor spins the duck moves linearly. When the duck reaches the ends it touches each limit switch. We are going to write a simple program to make the duck bounce back and forth between the two limit switches, like an arcade game. We know that positive power to the motor moves the duck towards the red direction. Because our robot is safely wired the switches will be normally closed.

```java
//Create some variables for our switches
DigitalInput forwardSwitch = new DigitalInput(2); //red switch
DigitalInput backwardSwitch = new DigitalInput(5); //blue switch

//Create a motor to control our motor
WPI_TalonFX motor = new WPI_TalonFX(4); //green motor

//Create a variable to store which direction we are moving the robot
boolean isForwardDirection = true;

//This loop is run over and over again
while (true) {

	// firstly check the sensors to see if they have been triggered
	
	//check the blue limit switch
	if(backwardSwitch.get() == false) {
		//This switch has been pressed (or unplugged)
		isForwardDirection = false;
	}

	//check the red limit switch
	if(forwardSwitch.get() == false) {
		//this switch has been pressed (or unplugged)
		isForwardDirection = true;
	}

	//Secondly Move the duck motor based on the current forward direction
	if(isForwardDirection == true) {
		//move the duck in the forward direction
		motor.set(ControlMode.PercentOutput, 0.3f);
	} else {
		//move the duck in the backwards direction
		motor.set(ControlMode.PercentOutput, -0.3f)
	}


	//TODO Safety check
	
}
