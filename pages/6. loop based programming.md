As we have seen previously all computers do are run from one instruction to the next. They do this very rapidly; think Billions of times per second. This means that the computer would run our code incredibly quickly! That is not useful. So we must use a loop to run our code over and over again. At a low level, this is a jump to a previous instruction. But at a high level, we can program loops like this in Java.
```java
while (true) {
	//Do something over and over again
}
```
For our simple robot we will program it to run in a loop. All robots are actually run this way. There is a control loop that runs over and over again, usually at a fixed interval. For our robots we will use an abstraction, just like everything else in programming. This loop here is abstracted from the machine code that the processor runs. Our robot code uses Commands and Subsystems to control complex robots.

# Duck Robot
In this example we will program a robot with 2 limit switches and a little rail driven by a motor. Here is what the robot looks like.
![duck_robot](/images/duck_robot.png)

The red direction in this diagram is forward and the blue direction is reverse. The duck is attached to the belt and when the motor spins the duck moves linearly. When the duck reaches the ends it touches each limit switch. We are going to write a simple program to make the duck bounce back and forth between the two limit switches, like an arcade game. We know that positive power to the motor moves the duck towards the red direction. Because our robot is safely wired the switches will be normally closed.

```java
//Create some variables for our switches
DigitalInput forwardSwitch = new DigitalInput(2); //red switch
DigitalInput backwardSwitch = new DigitalInput(5); //blue switch

//Create a motor to control our motor
WPI_TalonFX motor = new WPI_TalonFX(4); //green motor

//Create a variable to store which direction we are moving the robot
boolean isForwardDirection = true;


//This loop is run over and over again
while (true) {

	//invert the motor direction when the switch is pressed to prevent the motor from pushing the rubber duck into the edge of the robot and burning out the motor. 

	//check the blue limit switch
	if(backwardSwitch.get() ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ false) {
		//This switch has been pressed (or unplugged)
		isForwardDirection = false;
	}

	//check the red limit switch
	if(forwardSwitch.get() ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ false) {
		//this switch has been pressed (or unplugged)
		isForwardDirection = true;
	}

	//Secondly Move the duck motor based on the current forward direction
	if(isForwardDirection ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ true) {
		//move the duck in the forward direction
		motor.set(ControlMode.PercentOutput, 0.3f);
	} else {
		//move the duck in the backwards direction
		motor.set(ControlMode.PercentOutput, -0.3f)
	}
	
}
```

This code has a variable to track when the switches are pressed and it inverts a variable. This variable is used to track the **state** of the system and the motor is set based on the variable. This works well for a simple robot that has minimal logic like this one, however this workflow quickly becomes error prone when you have multiple systems working together.
 

# Driving Robot
Here we will look at a more complex robot that drives around on two wheels. However we want the robot to follow a path. Each robot wheel has an encoder on it to determine how far it has travelled. If we want it to follow a specific set of paths we must calculate each segment of the path that must be travelled (and technically speed too but this is a simple example and I am not going to go over the in depth math for calculating the speed and feeds. Oh yeah i am also not going to go over how to actually create functions and math equations to calculate the arc dimensions and properties. There are multiple cases especially depending on the center of rotation. There are also paths that do not travel exactly 90 degrees and I will not be discussing that at the moment either. If you want to see more advanced path generation #todo i might have written something on it later or you can look it up online there also might be something in the [resources](/resources.md) page). 

For now using this simple example my goal is just to discuss how problematic this style of programming ends up being. I am not going to implement this in the optimal way, ***intentionally***. However, this topic is relevant to robotics in general and it provides an easy way to create problematic code. 

Here is a diagram of the setup
![wheeeeelyboi](/images/wheeeeelyboi.png)

In this case the robot is 2 units wide. And we want to turn 90 degrees. Our first path is 6 units forward, then turn. The robot must wait for 2 seconds, then go 4 units forward. To calculate our turning, we need to know the distance that the wheels will travel along the curve; in this case it is the length of the arc. To make it simple, our arc will be centered such that we can just calculate 1 quadrant of the circle arc. In this case we can use the equation (*optional: figure out which situations this equation does not work; and try and derive an equation which works for any turning radius*): $$\frac{radius*\uptau}{360/rotation}$$
*NOTE: The symbol is $\uptau$ which is equal to $2\pi$*

For the blue wheel the distance is $3*\uptau/(90/360)$
For the red wheel the distance is $1*\uptau/(90/360)$

**Constants.java**
```java
static double falconMotorSensorUnits = 2048;
static double driveGearRatio = 8.14;
static double wheelDiameterMeters = 0.097;
```
**Robot.java**
```java
//Define the motors
WPI_TalonFX leftMotor = new WPI_TalonFX(3); //blue motor
WPI_TalonFX rightMotor = new WPI_TalonFX(4); //red motor

//Define functions to read the encoders built into the motors
double getLeftDistanceMeters () {
	return leftMotor.getSelectedSensorPosition() / (Constants.falconMotorSenorUnits * Constants.driveGearRatio) * (Math.PI * Constants.wheelDiameterMeters);
}

double getRightDistanceMeters () {
	return rightMotor.getSelectedSensorPosition() / (Constants.falconMotorSenorUnits * Constants.driveGearRatio) * (Math.PI * Constants.wheelDiameterMeters);
}

//Define variables for state
int currentStep = 0;
Timer waitTimer = new Timer();

//Distances for the turn
static double leftWheelDistance = 3*2*Math.PI/4;
static double rightWheelDistance = 2*Math.PI/4;

while (true) {

	switch(currentStep) {
		case 0:
			//Drive 6 units forward
			leftMotor.set(ControlMode.PercentOutput, 0.3);
			rightMotor.set(ControlMode.PercentOutput, 0.3);
			if(getLeftDistance() > 6 && getLeftDistance > 6) {
				//both motors have traveled greater than 6m
				currentStep = 1;
			}
			break;
		case 1:
			//Rotate 90 degrees
			leftMotor.set(ControlMode.PercentOutput, 0.3);
			rightMotor.set(ControlMode.PercentOutput, 0.3);
			if(getLeftDistance() > 6 + leftWheelDistance && getLeftDistance > 6 + rightWheelDistance) {
				//both motors have traveled greater than 6m
				currentStep = 2;
			}
			break;
		case 2:
			//Wait 2 seconds
			//Turn off the motors
			rightMotor.set(ControlMode.PercentOutput, 0);
			leftMotor.set(ControlMode.PercentOutput, 0);
			waitTimer.start();
			if(waitTimer.hasElapsed(2)) {
				currentStep = 3;
				waitTimer.reset();
				waitTimer.stop();
			}
			break;
		case 3:
			//Drive 4 units forward
			leftMotor.set(ControlMode.PercentOutput, 0.3);
			rightMotor.set(ControlMode.PercentOutput, 0.3);
			if(getLeftDistance() > 6 + leftWheelDistance + 4 && getLeftDistance > 6 + rightWheelDistance + 4) {
				//both motors have traveled greater than the required distance
				currentStep = 4;
			}
			break;
		default:
			//At the end of the steps stop the robot
			rightMotor.set(ControlMode.PercentOutput, 0);
			leftMotor.set(ControlMode.PercentOutput, 0);
			break;
	}	
}
```
NOTICE how how each step is based on the last one and chaning one step means we need to change all of the others. See how difficult this code is to read and maintain. We cannot easily perform actions based on inputs, and the robot can only do 1 "step" at a time, in only 1 order. This code actually has multiple issues with it. 

Another issue, for instance, is that we aren't able to precisely control that each motor has independently travelled the required distance. For a straight line, this might not be as much of a problem, but when it turns 90 degrees the two wheels are being driven at the same speed, and the condition to check if they have both travelled the required distance means that it will both travel about the same total distance before the condition is triggered. Which is not what we want to happen. We would need to check each motor distance and control it independently. This quickly gets complicated and prone to errors when we have multiple nested if statements.
